# EmpireMUD-Chat-Capture
![Preview](/preview.png?raw=true)
### Information:
This is a basic modification of lotj_channels (which creates a very nice chat capture miniwindow).

This version has most of the same functionality as the one Nyarko gave me, but I cleaned up a few parts.

Also wrote a function to manually convert color codes -- lotj_colors is exactly the same as the original.

### Credits:
Original script by Fiendish with help from Orogan, modified for LotJ by Johnson and for EmpireMUD by Nyarko and Hitsume.
