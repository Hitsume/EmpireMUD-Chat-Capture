# EmpireMUD-Chat-Capture
This is a basic modification of lotj_channels (which creates a very nice chat capture miniwindow).
This version has most of the same functionality as the one Nyarko gave me, but I cleaned up a few parts.
I have yet to check if the color parts work with extended color codes... my guess is 'probably not'.

Original script by Fiendish with help from Orogan, modified for LotJ by Johnson and for EmpireMUD by Nyarko and Hitsume.
