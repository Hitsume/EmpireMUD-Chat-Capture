# EmpireMUD-Chat-Capture
This is a basic modification of lotj_channels (which creates a very nice chat capture miniwindow).
This version has most of the same functionality as the one Nyarko gave me, but I cleaned up a few parts.
Also wrote a function to manually convert color codes -- lotj_colors is exactly the same as the original.

Original script by Fiendish with help from Orogan, modified for LotJ by Johnson and for EmpireMUD by Nyarko and Hitsume.
